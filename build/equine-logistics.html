                                We have a long relationship with horses, which began with JIT-Ex founder Adel Al Tamimi when he bought his first horse in 2001. Since then, horses are part of our identity and it has become obvious for us to develop Equine Transport as one of our priorities.


                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because of our deep understanding and passion for horses, we have set up a unique system that takes care of the horse during the Logistics process and makes sure that the horse arrives safely and happily to its final destination. We oversee and communicate strongly with our owners during the transport process, and this is something that sets us apart from other Equine Transport Companies.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                JIT-Ex has quickly become one of the leading international Horse Logistics companies rendering its services globally – including road transportation, air transportation, stable to stable, and quarantine to and from any international and intercontinental directions.
